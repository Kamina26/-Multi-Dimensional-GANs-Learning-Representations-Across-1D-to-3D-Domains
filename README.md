# -Multi-Dimensional-GANs-Learning-Representations-Across-1D-to-3D-Domains
This project explores 1D and 3D Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for data generation beyond images. It compares models that learn to create realistic sequential and volumetric data, showing GANsâ€™ potential in diverse real-world applications.
